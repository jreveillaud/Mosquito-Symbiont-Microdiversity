This project describes the bioinformatic reproductible workflow associated to the paper " The mosquito microbiome includes habitat-specific but rare symbionts". 

## Downloading the fastq files
Before everything else, you need to download the data and edit the paths file (available in /script/source/).
The raw illumina paired-end reads are stored in ENA and accesible with the accession number XXX. 

## Complete reproductible workflow
In the main script folder, there are multiple sub-folders numbered from 0 to 2 (each corresponding to a step of the global analysis) that need to be run one after the other. Each sub-folder includes multiple additional sub-folders strating with a letter from A to D and corresponding to a sub-step. 

To do the complete workflow, you thus need to run the scripts by number and letter order (0-A, 0-B,....1-A,1-B, etc).
