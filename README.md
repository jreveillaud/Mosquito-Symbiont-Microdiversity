This project describes the reproductible workflow associated to the paper " The mosquito microbiome includes habitat-specific but rare symbionts". 

## Downloading the fastq files
Before everything else, you need to download the data and edit the paths file (available in /script/source/paths.R).
The raw illumina paired-end reads are stored in ENA and accesible with the accession number XXX. 

## Complete reproductible workflow
In the script folder, there are multiple folders numbered from 0 to 2 and corresponding to a step of the global analysis. Each folder includes multiple sub-folders referred to as a letter from A to D and corresponding to a sub-step of the step. 

To do the complete workflow, you need to run the scripts by number and letter order.
